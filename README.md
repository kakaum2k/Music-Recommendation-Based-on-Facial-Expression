# 🎵 Music Recommendation Based on Facial Expression 🎧

Welcome to the "Music-Recommendation-Based-on-Facial-Expression" repository! This project is all about recommending music based on your facial expressions using the FER 2013 dataset and the Spotify app. By leveraging the power of machine learning, this project aims to create a music recommendation system that takes into account your emotions and facial expressions to suggest the perfect tunes for any mood.

## Description
Have you ever wanted a music playlist that perfectly matches your mood? Look no further! This project combines the fields of emotion recognition, machine learning, and music streaming to provide a unique music recommendation experience. By analyzing facial expressions captured through a camera, the system identifies the user's emotions and suggests music tracks that are likely to resonate with their current state of mind.

## How It Works
The core of this project lies in the integration of the FER 2013 dataset for facial expression recognition and the Spotify API for music recommendations. Using OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow for machine learning, the system detects emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more based on facial expressions. These emotional cues are then used to query the Spotify API and generate a customized playlist tailored to the user's mood.

## Features
🎶 Emotion-driven music recommendations  
🎭 Real-time facial expression analysis  
🔮 Machine learning algorithms for emotion detection  
🌟 Seamless integration with Spotify for music streaming  
🚀 User-friendly Flask application for easy interaction  
📊 Kaggle dataset used for training and validation
